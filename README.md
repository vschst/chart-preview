### Chart preview

> Node.js application to generate standalone PNG images for chart preview of data source

### Installation

##### Requirments
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed and package manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (which is included in the node distribution).

If you are using Ubuntu or Debian, these commands will install the last Node.js version respectively:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
````

##### Installation and build setup
###### Copying project files
Clone this repository into your `/var/www` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vschst/chart-preview.git
```

###### Install dependencies
```bash
cd chart-preview
npm install
```

###### Launch settings
This app listens on default port **3000** for connections.
To change the port, open the file [index.js](index.js) where you will see the line
```js
const port = 3000
```
You can change the value of the `port` variable to your own.

By default, the app updates charts every 30 minutes.
To do this, we uses the [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) task scheduler.
To change cron syntax, in the [index.js](index.js) file find
```js
const task = cron.schedule('0 */30 * * * *', async () => {
    
})
```
You can change the value `'0 */30 * * * *'` to your own according to the [settings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron#allowed-fields).

###### Test run command
```bash
npm start
```
Sample url for png file: `https://<your-host>:3000/<chart-name>.png`, where `<your-host>` and `<chart-name>` there are server host and config name of chart.

###### Terminate process
Run `killall -9 node` or `pkill -f node`

###### Start application to background
Install latest version of production process manager [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/):
```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```
Next, run command:
```bash
cd chart-preview
pm2 start npm --name "chart-preview" -- start
```
After that, process will run in the background. If you want to delete the app from the PM2 process list. You just have to enter the following command: `pm2 delete chart-preview`.

### Data source for charts
Supported data formats: CSV, CSV and JSON.
The data source structure for charts should be an JavaScript Array and look something like this:
```js
[
    {
        name: "abc",
        value1: 123,
        value2: 321.789
    }, 
    {
        name: "def",
        value1: 789.012,
        value2: 456
    }
]
```

By default, the first key value from the array is taken as the argument for the chart (along the x axis), and the second is taken for the value (along the y axis):
```js
const keys = Object.keys(d)   //  d - is a data item
const source = {
    argument: d[keys[0]],   //  argument is a d.name
    value: d[keys[1]]   //  value is a d.value1
}
```
However, you can customize the data selection using the accessor function (See chart configuration below).

### Charts configuration
You can customize the graphics in the file [names.js](charts/names.js).
Its structure is an associative array of objects:
```js
module.exports = {
    ['<chart-name>']: {
        //  Chart configuration options
    }
}
```
where `<chart-name>` this is the name of the chart, which should be unique.

###### Configuration options
- **url** `string` 

Chart data source URL.

- **format** `string`

Data source format. Possible values: `csv`, `tsv` or `json`.

- **accessor** `Function`

Optional configuration to pick data from data item.
Must be a function that returns a object with keys `argument` and `value`.
Example: 
```js
accessor: d => ({argument: d.name, value: d.value1})
```

- **prepare** `Function`

Optional configuration to prepare a value after it is read from the data source.
Must be a function. Example:
```js
prepare: d => Number(d) / 86400
```

- **type** `string`

Chart type. It can take the following values:
   1. **`line`** - to draw a linear chart
   2. **`line_acc`** - to draw a linear chart with value accumulation
   3. **`scatter`** - to draw a scatter chart
   4. **`bar`** - to draw a bar chart
   5. **`bar_acc`** - to draw a bar chart with value accumulation
   6. **`pie`** - to draw a pie chart
   
- **options** `Object`

Optional configuration for setting chart drawing options.
Must be an object with the following attributes: `color` - color in hex format of the chart line (works for all charts except pie chart), `colors` - array of colors in hex format to fill slices of pie chart (only for pie chart).
